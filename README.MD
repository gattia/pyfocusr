# PyFOCUSR

Python implementation of the FOCUSR <br>
FOCUSR = Feature Oriented Correspondence using Spectral Regularization and is described in [1]. 

# Introduction / Background

This package will find correspondence between points on two surfaces using spectral coordinate information to regularize the surface matching. Non-rigid registration between surface points is conducted using Coherent Point Drift (CPD) as described in [2] and impelmented in CyCPD [3]. More recent versions/updated versions of this (spectral alignment/registration) algorithm were developed by the original authors [4], [5] but are not covered here.

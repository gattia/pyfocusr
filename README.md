Python implementation of the FOCUSR <br>
FOCUSR = Feature Oriented Correspondence using Spectral Regularization and is described in [1]. 

# Introduction / Background

This package will find correspondence between points on two surfaces using spectral coordinate information to regularize the surface matching. Non-rigid registration between surface points is conducted using Coherent Point Drift (CPD) as described in [2] and impelmented in CyCPD [3]. More recent versions/updated versions of this (spectral alignment/registration) algorithm were developed by the original authors [4], [5] but are not covered here.

# Examples

Jupyter notebook *Example_registering_two_bone_meshes*  in /examples shows extended example with visualizations along the way. Some example steps include:

### Spectral coordinates
Normalized spectral coordinates (eigenvectors) are calculated for each mesh. Below shows examples for the first 3 eigenvectors. 


| *Eigen Vector 1 - Fiedler vector*    | *Eigen Vector 2*           | *Eigen Vector 3*           |

Next, the spectral coordinates (eigenvectors) for each node of the mesh (shown above) are used as xyz positions and are aligned.

The following includes the meshes at various steps of the registration process as well as one mesh calculated as the average of the source & target.
